Various Text Cleansing and Processing Techniques In NLP

This repository consist of various text preprocessing techniques which we required when we solving a Natural Language Processing problems with unstructured textual dataset.

Practical implementation and hands on experience gives us detail and In-Depth understanding of whatever we learn. Same thing I adpoted here to implement my learnings to clean, process real world textual dataset.
I have implemented all the techniques using **python3.5**.

Followings are the preprocessing techniques we covered in this repo:

    1. Stemming
    2. Lemmatization
